    <h2>Wars of the future will be fought over water : Water scarcity, a precursor to future conflicts</h2>
    <p class="word">Word count: 591</p>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Water scarcity is an increasingly pressing issue that affects over 40 percent of the global population, with projections indicating that this percentage will continue to rise in the coming decades (Howes, 2025). It threatens international peace and security and could lead to conflicts between nations and regions. This essay will examine the potential reasons behind the likelihood of water-related conflicts among sociological, geographical and economic factors.</p>
    
    <h3>Population Growth: Rising Demand</h3>
    <p>Water demand is escalating due to population growth and urbanization. The global population is expected to reach from 8 billion in 2023 to nearly 10 billion by 2058 (Roser & Ritchie, 2023). Humans can’t survive nor thrive without access to water. It is needed for irrigation, domestic supply, power generation, and various industries (Buckley, 2024). As populations grow, the demand for water is rising rapidly. Studies have shown water use has grown twice as fast as the world population (Werft, 2016). As a result, the issue of water scarcity will be more significant, and water will be more and more precious in the future. The competition for scarce resources often leads to conflict. When humans don’t have the things they want and need, they fight to get it. According to NASA, WWIII is going to be fought over the scarcity of water if things don’t change soon. (Werft, 2016). The potential for conflict over these shared resources has prompted numerous scholars and policymakers to consider the implications of water scarcity not only as an environmental issue but as a national security concern.</p>

    <h3>Uneven Distribution: Geographic Disparities</h3>
    <p>Freshwater resources are not evenly distributed across the globe, resulting in significant geographic disparities. For example, nations like Ethiopia made use of their water access to flourish and develop while others like Sudan relied heavily on the Nile River for their water supply (Williams, 2015). Moreover, climate change is worsening the disparity of water availability. Water-scarce areas may experience more droughts, while other regions may suffer from intensified flooding events (NGE, 2024). Water resource inequality has already led to conflict in many places of the world. Such inequalities in water resources have historically been a source of conflict, as nations dependent on external water sources may fear that others will stop providing them with access to essential water supplies or leverage their control to increase the water prices.</p>

    <h3>Economic Factors: Agricultural Dependency</h3>
    <p>Water scarcity is not merely an environmental concern, but it is also linked to economic factors, especially within agricultural societies. Many of the countries heavily rely on agriculture for their economic stability and food security (Beyeler, 2024). However, Agriculture accounts for approximately 70% of freshwater consumption (Ingrao et al, 2023). As freshwater resources become increasingly scarce, agricultural output will decline, resulting in food insecurity and economic instability. This affects national economies, leading to higher unemployment rates and increased poverty (Peng et al, 2024). Therefore, countries may realize how serious lack of water affects their livelihoods and leads to tensions between different countries.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion: Towards a Sustainable Future</h3>
    <p>In summary, water security has emerged as a critical issue for global security and has caused conflict. But still, it doesn’t mean we can’t prevent water-related wars of the future. To mitigate these challenges, international cooperation is essential. Every country should do their part in lowering water use. For example, embrace sustainable water usage practices and promote awareness about the importance of water conservation. Ultimately, the prevention of future water conflicts relies on the collective efforts of the global community to promote sustainable water management and diplomatic initiatives.</p>
