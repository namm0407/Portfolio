    <h2>Estimate my ecological footprint for the whole year</h2>
    <p class="word">Word count: 903</p>

    <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
    <p>This assignment is to calculate my ecological footprint by analyzing water, food, travel, and energy use over three days as a reference and estimate my ecological footprint for the whole year. Lastly, I would discuss strategies to reduce my environmental impact, emphasizing actionable changes. This exercise highlights the role of individual accountability in achieving sustainability.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Analysis my consumption style</h3>
    <p>Based on my ecological footprint data, the highest impact comes from beef, accounting for 0.0847 hectares of land use and 305 tons water use. Pork follows as the second highest contributor, with a requirement of 0.0638 hectares and 183 tons respectively. As shown, my meat consumption has the most environmental impact on both land and water use compared to other food categories. For instance, carbohydrates, ranked in third, consume only 0.0183 hectares, representing less than a quarter of the land required for beef production.</p>
    <p>In terms of energy use, electricity constitutes the largest portion of my ecological footprint. Electricity consumption accounts for 752 kg of carbon, whereas bus transportation contributes only 22.88 kg of carbon, which is about 33 times lower than electricity. This highlights the predominant role of electricity in my overall energy consumption.</p>

    <h3>3. Ecological footprint in Hong Kong</h3>
    <p>A notable similarity between my ecological footprint and that of the residents Hong Kong is our meat-heavy diet. Research conducted by the University of Hong Kong (2018) indicates that Hong Kong has one of the highest per capita meat consumption rates globally, with beef and pork being particularly prevalent. This dietary pattern contributes significantly to the city to be one of the world’s highest greenhouse gas emitter, with an emission rate of 136.31 kilograms (301 pounds) per capita. This heavy meat consumption has enormous environmental consequences. Out of all the meat, beef has the greatest impact. In beef production, a large amount of greenhouse gas is released, mainly in the form of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2). It emits 20 times more greenhouse gases compared to plant-based proteins (Dillon et al., 2021). Therefore, meat consumption, especially beef, has a large ecological impact.</p>
    <p>However, my transportation preferences may not align with the majority of Hong Kong residents. I use public transportation as there are a few bus stops and MTR stations in my neighborhood therefore it is very convenient for me. In contrast, despite the efficiency of Hong Kong’s public transport system, a significant proportion of the population favors private car travel. There were 719,535 licensed private cars in Hong Kong in 2024, which accounts for 71 per cent of all vehicles. with this number increasing annually (Colliers, 2024). Public transport systems are designed to carry large numbers of passengers with the energy consumption of a single vehicle, lowering energy consumption per person-kilometer compared to private vehicles. Li et al. (2024) assert that public transport is the key to reduce carbon emissions, thereby minimizing environmental impact.</p>

    <h3>4. Reflection and Improvements</h3>
    <p>After evaluating my ecological footprint, I recognize the necessity for adjusting my dietary preference to reduce my environmental impact. A modification I would make is to eat more vegetables instead of meat. Vegetables require substantially less land and water than meat, and beef in particular, generates much more carbon footprint relative to other meat production (Dillon et al., 2021). Therefore, transitioning to a diet that includes only pork and chicken may also be beneficial. However, some may argue that beef has high iron and protein content compared to other meat and plant-based foods (Shawal, n.d.). While it is true that beef has more nutrition, this concern would be fixed by consuming cultivated meat, also known as lab-grown meat. This alternative offers a promising solution for traditional animal agriculture in addressing deficiencies in essential nutrients such as iron and protein while having less environmental impacts. Research from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) have shown that at least 30% of energy consumption will have to be produced compared to traditional animal agriculture (Lee & Sauerwein, n.d.).</p>
    <p>Additionally, I also aim to decrease my electricity usage in my daily life. Lam and Li (2003) found that air conditioning was the major electricity end use, accounting for about 85% of total energy consumption in buildings. Simple actions, such as using fans instead of air conditioning can significantly lower overall energy consumption, contributing to a lower ecological footprint. Although critics may think that individual contributions are insignificant, I believe by modeling eco-friendly behaviors, individuals can inspire friends and family to follow suit. While individual efforts may seem minor, but with a large group of people fostering energy-efficient habits, a larger impact could be made collectively (GreenSmartEco, n.d.). Moreover, I think the government could regulate energy consumption in commercial spaces. Commercial buildings, particularly shopping centers, are major electricity end uses (Lam & Li, 2003). Implementing regulations on lowering the temperature of air conditioning system can significantly reduce electricity consumption of Hong Kong, reducing the city’s overall ecological footprint.</p>

    <h3>5. Conclusions</h3>
    <p>In summary, the analysis of my ecological footprint highlights the environmental impacts associated with my consumption patterns, particularly concerning meat and electricity use. It shows the need for dietary adjustments and changes in electricity usage. By making and encouraging collective action, individuals can play a vital role in addressing the pressing challenge of climate change and fostering a more sustainable future for Hong Kong.</p>
