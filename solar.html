    <h2>Potential solutions for Better Solar Energy Utilization in Hong Kong</h2>
    <p class="word">Word count: 2498</p>

    <p>1a. Introduction</p>
    <p>Solar energy is one of the most widely utilized forms of renewable energy. However, it has only gained traction in recent years in Hong Kong. Research by the Polytechnic University of Hong Kong (2012) highlighting the fact that Hong Kong has around 230,000 buildings, which is around 75% of all buildings, are suitable for solar energy harvesting. The total potential energy generated can reach a potential of 2.43TWh (PolyU HK, 2012), which is sufficient energy for more than 736 million three-person households to use annually. Despite such a massive potential, the solar energy use in Hong Kong is still quite low, with only 0.5% of solar energy contributing to the total energy generation in 2022 (IEA, 2022). The aim of the study is to explore possibilities in which solar energy can be implemented in a non-intrusive manner. The case studies explore potential ways to implement solar harvesters into existing infrastructure, allowing solar energy to be generated without needing a dedicated space.</p>
    <p>1b. Background research</p>
    <p>The issue of solar energy falls into the category of needing cleaner energy in Hong Kong. The status quo regarding solar energy is that it is related to environmental issues. Solar energy has attracted the attention of government officials and private companies alike. The Electrical and Mechanical Service Department in 2007 tested amorphous PV systems and mono-crystalline systems. Despite the lower overall system efficiency when compared to the mono-crystalline system (5.65% vs 8.785%), the amorphous PV system was noted to be more stable under the hot climate of Hong Kong summer (Wu & Lau, 2007).</p>
    <p>With regards to the current plans, the Climate Action Plan 2050 (CAP 2050) states that by 2035, renewable energy would occupy around 10% of total energy generation (CAP 2050, 2021). Strangely, solar energy would only contribute 2% of the total renewable energy share (HKSAR, 2024). Solar energy should be given more focus due to it being a much easier energy to implement when compared to wind and biofuel. With the urban environment of Hong Kong, solar energy is the most viable way of energy generation when applied to buildings and structures. The Government in recent years has done several projects to promote solar energy. The FiT scheme allows residents to sell energy generated from the solar panels installed at their households to the local electrical companies. This was proven to be successful as the scheme has attracted more locals to install solar panels (CAP 2050, 2021). Solar panels have also been introduced to school rooftops and reservoirs to maximize solar energy in these advantages locations (CAP 2050, 2021). Private companies have also invested in solar capture technology. The Kowloon Motor Bus company has implemented solar panels on bus shelters to power the lights at the stops (CAP 2050, 2021). There are more than 50 companies in Hong Kong that offer installation of solar technology (EnfSolar, n.d.). It could be said that Hong Kong is indeed interested in solar technology, yet it is not fully mature.</p>
    <p>Countries from around the world are all developing solar energy. China has the most energy generated (584 TWh), followed by the US (238 TWh), India (113 TWh) and Japan (96.9 TWh) (Ember Energy, 2023). As the whole world addresses sustainability issues, the growth of solar energy, and by extension, green energy will no doubt continue.</p>

    <p>2. Case studies</p>
    <p>This section discusses two case studies involving the application of amorphous silicon (a-Si) photovoltaic (PV)  technology in Hong Kong and overseas. They will be analyzed in terms of power output and effectiveness, covering schemes related to the respective cases as well as their feasibility in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>2a. Solar flooring in Hong Kong</p>
    <p>A new installation of PV tile flooring has been completed on the rooftop of a residential building in So Kwun Wat, Tuen Mun, utilizing a-Si cell technology for solar power generation. The flooring covers a total area of 10.8 square meters, consisting of 30 tiles, each with dimensions of 60x60 cm. Here, the efficiency and cost of a-Si floor tiles is discussed. </p>
    <p>The progress in increasing the efficiency and performance of a-Si technology has been remarkable over the years. According to Onyx (n.d.), the installers, the tiles are projected to deliver a nominal power of 133 Wp/mÂ², with an energy production of 5.2 kWh. This implies that at peak performance, the floor tiles may reach a conversion efficiency of up to 48%, while it was found that the average efficiency of a-Si was at 9.8% (Yang et al., 2020). Although a-Si exhibits one of the lowest efficiencies compared to other PV technologies, it has demonstrated superior performance under diffuse light conditions and possesses a low temperature coefficient, which allows it to potentially achieve its maximum hourly energy output per square meter during sunny, partly cloudy, cloudy and cold days (Yang et al., 2020). Thus, the floor tiles are projected to perform at their nominal power and energy production during daylight hours under these weather variations. Moreover, these tiles have been engineered with high durability and strong capacity to support heavy weight, which allows for practical usage of space constructed with the PV tiles as it converts solar energy into electrical energy (Onyx, n.d.).  A-Si technology can now be integrated into floor tiles without occupying additional space, contributing to space-usage efficiency and in addition to its stable performance, makes it ideal for solar power generation.</p>
    <p>Installing a-Si PV floor tiles involves substantial costs, but it can be a beneficial long-term investment economically and for environmental sustainability. Onyx (n.d.) reports that their company projects have an average payback period of 4 years with an average return on investment of more than 20% per year. Yang et. al (2020)  has also found that the construction of a-Si technology incurs greater soft and labour costs compared to hardware cost, and the estimated installation cost for a-Si system is at HKD45.9 Wp. Referencing this data, the PV floor tiles rated at 133 W p/m squared may cost HKD6,100, with soft costs accounting for approximately 65% of the total project expenditure. Nevertheless, the anticipated revenue generated from the floor tiles is considerable, especially with the Hong Kong FiT scheme in effect that significantly boosted the revenue. Assuming that Hong Kong receives 1,825 hours of sunlight annually (World Weather and Climate Information, n.d.) and a-Si floor tiles operate at its nominal efficiency, it can generate up to 9.49MW of energy. Without the FiT scheme, a-Si has an average payback time of 9 years with an annual income of HKD5,000, while under the FiT scheme, this PV floor tile project would generate an annual revenue approximately ranging between but not limited to HKD23,725 to HKD42,705, with a corresponding approximate daily income of HKD13 to HKD20.8 (Tse, 2024). With an a-Si floor tile rooftop, the return on investment is notably significant.</p>
    <p>In this project, the PV tiles were installed long after the construction of building completion in 2011, which shows how structural capacity and load bearing of Hong Kong buildings is suitable for similar PV technology installation. Overall, the a-Si floor tile systems have significant practical applications when installed on rooftops in Hong Kong, and possibly in areas that receive similar lighting conditions. Furthermore, the PV technology is also constantly developing which suggests that a-Si could attain better configurations and have higher cost-effectiveness.</p>

    <p>2b. Solar cycle path in Utrecht</p>
    <p>The solar bike path in Maartensdijk, near Utrecht, Netherlands, is a project that integrates photovoltaic technology into transportation infrastructure. Opened in July 2021, this 330-meter bike path is the world's longest solar bike path. The project was developed through a collaboration between the Province of Utrecht and construction company BAM Infra Nederland.</p>
    <p>The bike path consists of prefabricated concrete elements embedded with solar cells. To protect the solar cell from damage due to the surroundings like the vehicles, the cells are protected by getting a translucent layer of tempered glass as cover. This innovative design allows cyclists to ride safely while the solar panels beneath capture solar energy. The surface was under treatment to be rough to provide enough friction for cyclists to ride on safely. The modules were specifically engineered to withstand the weight of daily bicycle traffic while maintaining optimal energy generation capacity.</p>
    <p>Regarding energy efficiency, the PV tiles here have an efficiency of 21 %, slightly lower than the normal solar panels for residential use. The project cost more than 1.3M euros in total. Since its operation, the path generates approximately 127 MWh of electricity annually, which is sufficient to power roughly 40 households in the region. Meanwhile, the path serves an average of 1,500 cyclists daily, demonstrating its dual functionality as an energy generator and transportation infrastructure.</p>
    <p>Regarding durability, the solar modules have shown remarkable resilience to regular wear and tear. The tempered glass surface has maintained its integrity despite constant bicycle traffic and varying weather conditions. The non-slip surface treatment has proven effective in ensuring cyclist safety, even during wet conditions, which was initially a concern during the project's planning phase.</p>
    <p>The approach of hiding PV tiles under bike tracks shows some potential applications in Hong Kong. The advantage of the PV tile is that it takes advantage of the space of the road surface. While there is a lack of flatland in Hong Kong, the approach could be a brilliant idea to produce renewable energy in the limited flatland. Meanwhile, Hong Kong has a cycling track network of over 240 kilometres in the New Territories, which shows a high potential to implement the modules. In addition, this path could help promote cycling in Hong Kong due to its uniqueness.</p>
    <p>However, implementing the solar cycle track in Hong Kong shall face a serious financial challenge. Given that the 300m cycle track in the Netherlands spent 1.3M euros, similar projects in Hong Kong may also face such tremendous costs, primarily due to high labour costs and stringent safety requirements. The best approach would be to create a pilot scheme where only a short section of bike path is covered to gauge the effectiveness and the publicâs interest. An advantage that Hong Kong has is that it has the support of China, a giant in the solar energy sector. It is likely that China can provide affordable materials if Hong Kong is to create such schemes.</p>
    
    <p>3. Discussion</p>
    <p>3a. Expected outcomes and challenges</p>
    <p>Having solar harvesters in residential and public spaces can help reduce the use of fossil fuel.  The use of fossil fuels to create energy releases harmful byproducts into our atmosphere (SGS, 2022). Solar energy serves as an alternative way to provide energy as it is a clean and renewable energy. It has the potential of becoming a major green energy in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Solar panels have a lifespan of up to 25 to 30 years. However, during those times, some internal and external conditions that affect their overall efficiency. For example, the performance of photovoltaic modules and balance of systems gradually declines overtime. Studies have shown, after some years of use, each year there will be some percentage of their efficiency lost (TSS, 2024).</p>
    <p>It should also be noted that maintenance and implementation can be challenging. Regular maintenance of solar panels is legally required to ensure they function properly. There may be a need for replacement of small panel parts if the components do not meet the standard. Furthermore, improper cleaning of the surface of solar panels can reduce their efficiency, so users have to learn how to clean them correctly (Bolt, 2023).</p>
    <p>3b. Evaluation</p>
    <p>Installing solar harvest technology in public or residential spaces, like the Solar Flooring Project in Hong Kong's residential estates, can contribute to several Sustainable Development Goals: climate change, innovation and infrastructure and economic development.</p>
    <p>Goals: climate change, innovation and infrastructure and economic development.</p>
    <p>The first sustainable development goal it has met was addressing climate change by providing affordable and clean energy. By implementing and developing more of such public space solar harvesters, it meets some targets of SDG 7, increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix and allowing residents to access clean energy. Rooftop solar is around 12 times cleaner than natural gas and 20 times cleaner than coal (Solar, 2024). In fact, the average residential solar panel system in the UK saves 0.7 tonnes of carbon dioxide each year (Howell & Clissitt, 2024). If more Solar Flooring Projects are implemented in Hong Kong, we could significantly reduce carbon footprint and improve our green energy share.</p>
    <p>The second one is innovation and infrastructure. People often believe renewable energy cannot be sufficiently used in Hong Kong due to space and other limitations (Hui, 2003) The Solar Flooring Project is particularly suitable for urbanized cities as it is space efficient. It allows new innovations to take place in existing infrastructure. It can be installed underutilized space, such as rooftops, parking lots or on walkways. These innovative floor systems are designed with high-efficiency solar cells while providing walkable surfaces, allowing citizens to generate energy effortlessly as they go about their daily activities (Markham, 2024). Solar flooring and roads will likely be explored in the future. Despite the current setbacks and limitations, new innovations will happen, making solar harvest technology more efficient as a whole.</p>
    <p>The third one is economic development as it offers partnership and job creations. Such solar projects, both residential and public space ones, need partnership between different parties. The FiT scheme is only successful as the residents, electricity companies and the Government cooperate with one another. The Onyx installation is the cooperation between Onyx and the land developers. Moreover, installing solar floorings require electrical knowledge to ensure safe connections to the electrical system, predictive calculations to ensure the solar floors are able to withstand certain loads, abide by regulations and work in optimal conditions (GFG, 2024). Therefore, engineers, electricians and building inspectors are needed, creating more job opportunities. This enhances cooperation between different professions. If more solar projects are to happen in the future, cooperation and partnership between companies, residents and authorities will inevitably happen.</p>

    <p>4. Conclusion</p>
    <p>In this report we examined examples of how solar harvesters can be implemented in a manner which is compatible with existing infrastructure. Solar flooring can be installed on paths in private residential areas exposed to sunlight and bike lanes. It is true that solar energy technology is hindered by its comparatively short lifespan as well as higher maintenance costs as the components break down after long periods of use. Not only that, the cost of installing it in the first place may be high due to the innovative and unique nature of the projects. However, as cities around the world explore methods to become more sustainable, these projects provide excellent examples of what could be done in the future. Renewable energy will only become more intertwined with our lives and solar harvesting installations will only be more prevalent in public and residential spaces.</p>
