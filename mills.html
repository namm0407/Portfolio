    <h2>The Mills : A Cultural And Creative Landmark</h2>
    <p class="word">Word count: 820</p>

    <p>Have you ever visited The Mills — the former Nan Fung Textiles factory buildings in Tsuen Wan? This historical building has been transformed into a creative space that celebrates local art and Hong Kong’s rich textile history. In this reflection writing, I will explore The Mills’s textile heritage and its role in sustainable urban development.</p>
    <p>From the 1950s to the 1970s, Hong Kong's manufacturing industry was booming. Nan Fung Textile, now known as The Mills, was one of the many factories born in that golden age, making it one of the yarn mills with the highest output in Hong Kong. But good times don’t last forever, by the 1990s, many factories began to close or relocate to countries with lower labor costs and Nanfeng Textile was converted into a warehouse in 2008. It underwent revitalization work in 2014 and was reopened in 2018 as a hub for work, a textile cultural and arts center, retail areas, and recreation (LUXE, 2024). </p>
    <p>To begin with, in terms of heritage conservation and revitalisation, preserving a historical building allows us and the future generations to honor the past and foster a sense of identity and pride in the community. So instead of demolishing it, the owners embarked on a revitalisation plan that maintains the building’s historical essence while enriching the local community. Even though the building underwent revitalization work, they still keep quite a few things untouched to fully show what the factory used to be like. For example,the logo with the original words "Nan Fung Textile Co., Ltd." on the exterior wall, the fire barrels they use before fire extinguishers exist, the factory’s original front gates, etc (Cheng, 2024). The building is filled with drawings to tell its history. For instance, the drawing painted outside the building, “Unsung hero”, pays tribute to the struggle of the past textile workers and symbolizes the resilience of previous generations in Hong Kong (Leung, 2018). Besides the permanents, the Mills also hosts themed exhibitions, they not only display old cotton spinning objects, collections and photos, but visitors are also allowed to operate old textile tools and experience the cotton spinning process (Leung, 2018). This immersive approach allows visitors to glimpse into the life of workers in the textile factory in the old days.</p>
    <p>Apart from heritage conservation and revitalisation, it also plays a role in stimulating economic growth. Hong Kong being labeled as the “cultural desert”, where art markets are struggling to thrive due to a limited number of buyers who are willing to invest in local art. I believe it is because schools and parents prioritize academic studies over art education. Art is considered as a hobby, if not, a waste of time. Therefore, led to lack of appreciation for art due to a lack of exposure and understanding of different art forms. The Mills have educational hand-on workshops to provide art classes to engage individuals interested in arts (Leung, 2018). By offering curated art experiences, The Mills attracts diverse audiences and stimulates interest in local art. After they realize the time and effort artists put in the arts, they may appreciate art more and are more willing to support local art. The Mills is a concentrated place for local art shops. This can create a loyal customer base. There are seven floors in The Mills and four of those floors are filled with local small businesses, such as art shops, hands-on workshops, start-up restaurants and cafes (Cheng, 2024). Therefore, visitors can have a relaxing time while supporting small local businesses in Hong Kong. </p>
    <p>My visit to The Mills felt like stepping into a fusion of a historical museum and a contemporary art space. The Mills has successfully attracted the attention of both locals and tourists. They come to enjoy their time and take some memorable photographs while learning about the local history and culture. This type of revitalisation has actually inspired another historical building, such as the Central Market to revitalize for future generations while supporting local startups, which have also successfully grasped people's attention. Therefore, I think the government should also take The Mills as reference on managing historical sites. The government owned most of the property of the historical buildings and revitalisation is a recommended way to manage those buildings. I think that it is a good way to make use of Hong Kong’s historical buildings instead of restricting access or demolishing them, or else next generations may be disconnected from their history. </p>
    <p>In summary, The preservation of historical buildings is essential and doing a revitalisation like The Mills not only preserves the historical buildings for historical and cultural purposes, but it also makes good use of the space. It allows visitors to hang out in the open space and cafes and have fun in the workshops. </p>
