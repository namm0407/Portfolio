    <h2>Report on having edible inserts as alternative food source</h2>
    <p class="word">Word count: 1189</p>

    <p>1. Introduction</p>
    <p>As the global population becomes more intense, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has predicted a increase of 70% in food production demand. To overcome the challenge of insufficient food for future generations, the practice of humans eating insects, which is known as entomophagy (Sogari et al, 2022), has been considered as one of the solutions to mitigate the food demand (Mariutti & Roberts, 2021). However, concerns about food safety and hygiene have been raised (Han & Shin, 2019) and people are worried that consuming insects or insect-based product would damage their health. Despite these concerns, this report aims to demonstrate why edible inserts could be an alternative food source, define the barriers, and provide some corresponding recommendations to mitigate the barriers mentioned.</p>
    
    <p>2. Reasons to promote edible inserts</p>
    <p>This section will give two justification for promoting edible inserts : nutrition values and environment sustainability.</p>
    <p>2.1  High nutrition values</p>
    <p>Firstly, edible inserts have high concentration of nutrients, such as proteins and fibers (Marutti & Roberts, 2021). By eating insects, individuals can have an alternative way of getting nutrients and improve their health. However, the process of rearing insects can be expensive as it requires the construction of facilities and investments in insect farms (FAO, 2021). [BP5] Although the cost required could be high, the Food and Agriculture Organization (2021) provided some alternative methods to reduce the cost of insect subtraction, such as breeding insects using agricultural wastes or side streams.</p>
    <p>2.2  Environmental-friendly</p>
    <p>Secondly, consuming edible insects is also a way to save the environment. Rearing of edible insects requires less water consumption and generates fewer greenhouse gasses and ammonia compared to livestock farming (Mariutti & Roberts, 2021). Despite that, some have doubts about the environmental benefits as collecting insects may cause ecological damage, such as habitat destruction or collapse of insect population (Mariutti & Roberts, 2021). However, they are overlooking the fact that it could reduce the ecological impact of other animals, such as cows and fish, as these are common animal-based food,. As a result, entomophagy could help preserving agricultural resources (Lange 2021). </p>
    
    <p>3. Barriers</p>
    <p>The following section highlights the barriers promoting edible insects, which include concerns about food safety and unfamiliarity.</p>
    <p>3.1  Food safety</p>
    <p>The Food and Agriculture Organization (2021) has stated that insects may contain biological and chemical contaminants and it is challenging to remove these harmful substances due to their small size. Therefore, there are health risk concerns regarding the consumption of edible insects (Sogari et al., 2022). These concerns are not without justification as many insect farmers only work part-time so they lack necessary skills in handling the insects and pest control (Han & Shin, 2019).[BP6]  Kooh el al (2019, as cited in FAO, 2021) have shown that poorly controlled hygienic conditions can serve as a vector for microorganisms, posing a risk to human health. Consequently, the edible insects may have lots of bacteria.</p>
    <p>3.2  Unacceptance due to unfamiliarity</p>
    <p>Consumer unacceptance is a huge barrier for promoting edible insects (Sogari et al., 2022). Payne et al (2019, as cited in Sogari et al., 2022) suggested that unfamiliarity is one of the primary reasons for low acceptance of edible insects. Edible insects have numerous benefits, such as high nutriental values and environmental friendliness (Mariutt & Roberts, 2021) but this information provided about edible insects are widely known. Mariutt and Roberts (2021) stated that trusted sources providing more information about edible insects in aspects of their nutrition values, environmental impact and food safety would result in greater accepance of edible insects. The lack of relaible sources highlighting the advantages of consuming edible insects has led many to hesitate in recognizing them as an alternative food source.</p>

    <p>4. Recommendations</p>
    <p>This section provides recommendations in response to the aforementioned barriers, namely food hygiene oncerns and lack of information respectively.</p>
    <p>4.1  Better regulations</p>
    <p>Implementing better regulations can help alleviate the concerns about food safety. The Food and Agriculture Organization (2021) suggested that good hygienic practice could reduce microbial risk in the rearing, handling process. Therefore, the government should establish strict and detailed regulations to ensure the safety of edible insects for human consumption. Han and Shin (2019) also recommend that the government should also provide education and training for farmers to ensure the quality control of insect production. [BP9] While it is true that better regulations can reduce the bacterial contamination in the edible inserts, some argue that the insects can become contaminated during the process. For example, when edible insects are sun-dried, the humidity in air would allow the microbial growth due to moisture (FAO, 2021). And Lange (2021) has shown that ground spraying is a common method to kill pesticides, but it would put human health at risk and possibly cause food poisoning. However, there are some effective ways to eliminate foodborne pathogens for this situation, such as selling ‘ready-to-eat’ insects in roasted or fried form, as high temperture could kill bacterias (FAO, 2021) and the ground spraying could be avoided by having an edible insect farm in a controlled farming condition instead of getting insects from the wild [BP10] (Lange, 2021). As shown regulations can enhance the safety of edible insects.</p>
    <p>4.2  Gain product awareness though celebrities</p>
    <p>In order to address the issue of insufficient product awareness, insect-based brands could consider promoting their products through celebrity endorsements (Han & Shin, 2019). By having celebrities introduce edible insects to their fans and the general public, as well as talking about the benefits of eating edible insects could gain exposure of edible insects and encourage more people to purchase insect-based products (Han & Shin, 2019). While celebrity endorsements may allow more people to understand the positive value insect-based products offer, some argue that people may be reluctant to onsume insects not because they are unaware of the benefits, but rather than due to sense of disgust by it. Studies done by Wendin and Nyberg (2021, as cited in Sogari et al., 2022) showed that disgust of eating insects are one of the major barriers to unacceptance of edible insects in Western. However, this issue can be easily resolved by altering the form in which the insectsare presented. One common approach is to offer the insect in form of powder (Sogari et al., 2022). Consumer studies from Onwezen et al. (2021, Sogari et al., 2022) also suggested that incorporating insects in familiar food products, such as bread and biscuits, can help oversoming the barriers. This would make the product look more appealing and potentially increase consumers’ willingness to try insects or at least insect-based products.</p>
    <p>5. Conclusion</p>
    <p>Judging from the above analysis, edible insects have benefits in different aspects, like human health and the environment. Even though there are some possible barriers that deter the promotion of edible insects being an alternative food source, most barriers could be mitigated with better regulations and increasing the awareness, which could lighten the concerns towards insect-based food.[BP11]  To recapitulate, edible insects have potential to address the growing food demand and sustain the food production.[BP12]  Therefore, it should be promoted as long as the safety of the product is ensured.</p>
