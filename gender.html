    <h2>Are we defined by our gender?</h2>
    <p class="word">Word count: 2932</p>

    <p>What does it mean to be a man? What does it mean to be a woman? Society uses the X and Y chromosomes in our DNA to define our gender and expect us to act accordingly. But should we? In this essay, we will discuss how we learn about our gender identities and how our understanding in gender identities creates barriers for the gender non-normatives to be fully accepted by society.</p>
    <p>Is it a boy or a girl? This is the first question everybody asks when we are born. This inquiry marks our first identity. Some people decide to change it later in their life and many ask, ‘So are you a man or a woman?’ (A4TE, 2022). It seems that society must categorize our gender into two boxes, a concept ingrained in us from a young age.</p>
    <p>When we were kids, we were sent to school to get education. While schools provide us with textbook knowledge, it also gives us an environment to interact with our peers and teachers. Schools play a crucial role in shaping individuals and society as a whole. Our childhood experiences significantly impact our understanding of the world, including our personal values and gender identities. When we are in school, we must follow school rules, such as no tank tops, no yoga pants, dress must be over the knees, no high-heel shoes, no bracelets, necklaces or earrings, no dyed hair, and so much more dress code restrictions (Cooper, 2024). Did you notice most of the dress code tends to target female students? Dress code is basically telling female students they should dress in a certain way because their clothing are distracting the boys. And when female students wear clothes and dresses that are slightly shorter because it’s “too hot out” or because it’s “attractive,” they were told that you are making a distracting working environment for the boys, which is basically saying, “your clothing is more important than their education.” (Bartko, 2017). As shown, Society thinks that women should be more conservative instead of educating boys that girls are not sexual objects. Furthermore, schools are more supportive of males than females. Teachers may unconsciously expect boys to take on leadership roles in group activities, further promoting assertive behavior (Franklin II & Clye, 1997). In conclusion, school limits the opportunities for girls to present themselves, both sexually and in peer activity (Fevre, 2023). This may lead to girls thinking their gender is inferior compared to boys as they are treated like objects.</p>
    <p>However, some may argue that girls are out-performing boys academically, which may lead to a better career path than boys. This breaks the belief that men are better than women (Fevre, 2023). While it is true that more women are getting better exam results than men, schools also show they want or expect girls to be responsible for housework and cooking by setting up home economics lessons. Home economics is a subject that teaches students needlework, baking and meal preparation every once a week. In Hong Kong, all single-sex boy’s schools do not offer home economics lessons while it is a compulsory program in their curriculum for most of the all-girls-school (EOC, 1999). Schools often design their curricula based on what they believe aligns with societal expectations. All-girls schools may prioritize home economics to provide practical skills for future roles. As you can see, society expects girls will grow up to be stay-at-home wives while men will be the breadwinner of the family, therefore not needing these types of skills.</p>
    <p>Aside from traditional gender stereotypes, we also learn about different types of gender from peer interactions at school. About 15 years ago, the term LGBTQ+ was not widely recognized. Nowadays, it is a hot topic, isn’t it? We have clashing opinions. In school, students will engage in conversations with their peers or their teachers about various topics, possibly including LGBTQ. This topic may occur more often than you think now that we have so many movies and TV shows featuring characters from the LGBTQ+ community (BBC, 2022). Students may ask questions or share experiences about this topic. These discussions promote awareness and understanding for types of gender other than the traditional two gender. Moreover, there are different types of people in school, including LGBTQ+ members. When LGBTQ+ identities are represented among peers, it helps normalize these experiences, making them more relatable (Collins & Ehrenhalt, 2023). By interacting with LGBTQ+ peers, they will realize we are all the same no matter what our gender identity is and know that it is not ‘weird’ if they didn’t identify themselves as the society expected. It increases acceptance and normalizes different types of gender identities. </p>
    <p>Although, some may say that since schools usually have religions and most mainstream religions deny gay rights and thwart women's attempts to pursue careers (Franklin II & Clye, 1997), students may adopt beliefs and values in their religious studies, viewing LGBTQ+ identities as taboo and unacceptable. Even though schools should be promoting support to the LGBTQ+ community, they shouldn’t avoid students from getting information that is opposite to what they are trying to teach. They can’t. Instead, they could take this as an opportunity to teach students to respect people with different opinions and encourage students to explore different viewpoints, including those that support and oppose LGBTQ+ rights to fully understand the complexity of the issue before taking a stand. This would allow them to be critical on evaluating information instead of blindly accepting what they are told. In addition, schools can also have education on LGBTQ. In the UK, all primary schools are mandatory to teach children about different types of families, including LGBTQ families starting from September 2020 (SAAS, 2019). More schools, from around the world, have provided lectures and education lessons on LGBTQ to ensure students understand what LGBTQ actually is. Despite schools’ effort on increasing awareness of different gender identities, some students are still struggling to accept LGBTQ+ members. In a TED talk, Andrew Solomon shared his experiences as a gay child in school.</p>
    <p>Andrew Solomon is a multifaceted individual — an accomplished writer, lecturer and activist for LGBT+ rights. However, he does not have a happy childhood. Because of his sexuality, he faced discrimination at a young age. When he was in second grade, his classmate Bobby Finkel had a birthday party and invited everyone in his class but him. His mother assumed there had been a mistake, so she called Mrs. Finkel, just to learn that Bobby simply did not want Solomon at his party. His mother took him to the zoo afterward to cheer him up (Solomon, 2019). But he knew then and there, his identity was not welcomed by society. He was left out, excluded even. This experience illustrates how traditional views on gender and sexuality can marginalize those who do not conform to societal norms. People often perceive differences in sexuality as abnormal, leading to a tendency to gravitate toward those who share similar backgrounds, interests, or beliefs. This familiarity can create a sense of safety and comfort, but it also fosters barriers between individuals based on differences in identity. </p>
    <p>In seventh grade, some kids on his school bus nicknamed him "Percy", a slang that suggest someone is effeminate or has traits stereotypically associated with being gay, and they used this nickname to mock him in the entire school bus ride (Solomon, 2019). Society regards heterosexuals as “normal”, making other sexual possibilities seem strange or unacceptable to many. This perception can lead individuals to react negatively to those who are different from them, leading to bullying as a form of expressing those biases. </p>
    <p>He wanted to seek for help, but he perished this thought after hearing his science teacher told the class that all male homosexuals develop fecal incontinence because of the trauma to their anal sphincter. This misinformation contributed to his feelings of isolation. He graduated high school without ever going to the cafeteria, where if he sat with the girls, he would be laughed at for doing so, or if he sat with the boys, he would be laughed at for being a boy who should be sitting with the girls (Solomon, 2019).  This example illustrates how a lack of education and awareness marginalizes gender non-conforming individuals. Solomon referenced harmful stereotypes and misinformation about gay individuals, demonstrating that limited knowledge can lead to the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes. Such misconceptions foster an environment of fear and misunderstanding, making it difficult for individuals to express their identities without facing backlash.</p>
    <p>When individuals feel unsafe in expressing themselves or being accepted in social settings. They may feel like misfits. Solomon shared moments when he wanted to hide his identity due to societal rejection, stating, “I would have had an easier life if I were straight”. This statement reflects the internal conflict faced by those who feel pressured to conceal and alter their identities. Unfortunately, there is a lack of support system for the LBGTQ+ community in school (Minero, 2018). While schools are meant to educate the next generation by providing both academic knowledge and interpersonal skills, they frequently overlook the positive narratives and contributions of LGBTQ+ individuals. Misinformation about LGBTQ+ issues, such as the harmful statements made by Solomon’s science teacher, can lead students to adopt damaging stereotypes. This creates barriers between genderqueer individuals and those who adhere to traditional gender norms. </p>
    <p>Solomon represents just a tip of the iceberg, there are so many more gender non-normatives out here being seen as outsiders, misfits, oddballs due to traditional views of gender. However, as more have spoken up and engaged in intellectual and political movements. Awareness is increasing, and society is gradually accepting members of the LGBTQ+ community. The notion that gender is not merely a biological or fixed attribute but rather something that is performed and constructed through social interactions is encapsulated in the term “doing gender,” introduced by West and Zimmerman.</p>
    <p>According to West and Zimmerman (1987), gender isn’t something that we “are”. It is something that we “do”. Doing gender suggests that gender can be fluid and that individuals can express their gender in various ways, beyond the rigid categories of male and female or heterosexual and homosexual. In simple words, doing gender means that individuals actively obey and break gender rules (Lu et al., 2021). Lorber (2005) shared his experience of seeing a child wearing a blue T-shirt and dark pants with a Yankee baseball cap. So, he automatically assumed the child to be a boy but he soon realized the little flowered sneakers, lace-trimmed socks and tiny earrings the child was also wearing. This phenomenon highlighted how gender roles have changed. Historically, there was a cultural belief that blue is for boys and pink is for girls (Haller, 2021), making it unusual to see a boy wearing pink on the street. In modern days, it is increasingly common to see men taking care of babies in public or girls and boys wearing unisex clothing. Suggesting that contemporary parents avoid reinforcing traditional gender roles for their children, allowing them to choose items based on personal style rather than societal expectations. This shift allows greater freedom in self-expression for their child. Doing gender allows us to see beyond the sexual stereotypes and not let it limit our style and behavior. </p>
    <p>Despite this progress, many still hold traditional values. Critics argue that if we learn about gender identity through doing gender, we are encouraging people to do things that reinforce traditional gender norms, which could lead to misunderstanding and getting teased. For example, men wearing feminine clothes would be called a “pussy” while tomboys might be misinterpreted for their sex due to traditional lenses. Members of the band Måneskin, Damiano David and Thomas Raggi, have been facing criticisms for their use of makeup and choice of clothing. Claiming that straight guys should never wear makeup nor high heels and we should conform to societal expectations about appearance (Duncan, 2023). </p>
    <p>While it is true that not everyone is used to seeing others dressed this way, they should not feel compelled to hide their true selves to appease societal norms. History has shown that the non-normative had a hard life concealing their identities. They should no longer be restricted by gendered clothing choices merely to fit traditional perceptions. The traditional values are outdated and misaligned with contemporary values (Brodowicz, 2024). People are just not used to it yet because the awareness of doing gender is still quite new to them.  As awareness of “doing gender” continues to grow, society will gradually recognize the diversity in gender expression.</p>
    <p>Apart from seeing beyond the social norms, doing gender also helps me understand the non-binary culture. While many identify themselves as men or women, others embrace identities such as non-binary, genderqueer, genderfluid, or other identities that do not fit within the traditional binary framework. Doing gender encourages us to question traditional gender roles and prioritize individual expression over societal expectations, allowing us to view the LQBTQ+ community without judgmental glasses and understand ourselves better instead of seeing ourselves as what we were told. It empowers individuals to explore and redefine their identities without judgment.</p>
    <p>Some argue and say that only a small portion of people accept gender non-normatives. Traditional values have lasted for over a century, and many believe they are upheld for valid reasons (Brodowicz, 2024). Doing gender encourages people to conform to social norms. But just because some see gender though individual actions and institutional structures or systems doesn’t mean others will too. For example, if gay couples are seen together in public, they may get some weird looks, and transgender are often being called “human monsters”, a direct translation from the Chinese word. In the past, they hid their true self to not get marginalized by society. Doing gender encourages them to express their gender through their actions and appearance. Which may lead them to live their worst nightmare if the ones close to them hold traditional values.</p>
    <p>Even though people don’t change their mind about things easily, statistics have shown that the acceptance of homosexuals has been increasing globally, from 46% in 1994 to 74% in 2019 (PRC, 2020) and there are currently 36 countries, where same-sex marriage is legal (Choi et al., 2024). As you can see, gender non-normatives are becoming the new normal. Time is changing, the idea of not having only two gender are widely accepted. Nowadays, media representation of LGBTQ+ relationships is more prevalent. According to BBC news (2022), out of 775 series-regular characters on broadcast TV, 11.9% are LGBT. Promoting LGBTQ representation in movies and TV can help normalize LGBTQ identities and experiences, leading to greater acceptance in society. </p>
    <p>Doing gender encourages us to evaluate individuals based on their merits rather than their traditional gender roles. In the past, society believed in stereotyped sexual roles suggested by Talcott Parsons, he claims women were to serve as homemakers and nurturers while men were to work outside the home and serve their families as breadwinners (Katz & Moffitt, 2023) and the jobs are shaped by societal norms, like male doctor and female nurse (West & Zimmerman, 1987). Nowadays, companies and organizations are increasingly hiring based on ability rather than gender. National University did a survey (2024), indicated that male nurses have increased from 8% in 2015 to 11.2% in 2022. And programs like National Research Mentoring Network (NRMN) were made to attract more women to science with the aim to show equity within the academic field (Harris, 2022, as cited in Kalev et al., 2006). Now, over one million women now work in STEM occupations, which is about 29% (IET, 2024). Organizations showing support in women's careers by offering more opportunities, reflecting a significant shift in gender dynamics within the workforce, particularly in traditionally gendered occupations. </p>
    <p>Nevertheless, despite the increase in female representation, men are still more likely to get a promotion. Research shows that 58% of women face doubts about their ability to achieve work-life balance (Dashper, 2019) and even though there are more women than men with higher education institutions, woman continue to struggle in getting top positions in local government (Cortland & Kinias, 2019, as cited in OECD, 2017; French & Eskridge, 2020). This suggests that some organizations only wanted to appear as a diverse company, therefore hire women to make them seem like they support workplace diversity and gender equality for company image (Harris, 2022). </p>
    <p>Regardless of what their true intentions are, they do tend to hire more women to do so. Doing gender reminded us that gender is a performance shaped by social interactions. Therefore, women can change stereotypes through their actions in the workplace by demonstrating their capabilities and exceeding job expectations. By consistently achieving high performance, their co-workers and supervisors will see them for their achievements and breaking the gender stereotype they have of her (Catalyst, 2017). They may be more willing to let more women get promotions to a higher position. An example to illustrate this is the former chief executive of Hong Kong, Carrie Lam. She is the first female leader of Hong Kong and an example of a woman landing a job with top positions in local government (Kam, 2017).</p>
    <p>Judging from the above analysis, the journey of understanding gender identity is highly influenced by socialization processes. Educational institutions play a pivotal role in shaping these perceptions, either reinforcing traditional stereotypes or promoting acceptance and diversity. By challenging outdated norms and fostering open dialogue, we can create a society that values all gender identities, allowing everyone to express themselves freely without fear of judgment.</p>
